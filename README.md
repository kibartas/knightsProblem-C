A program that provides layouts for the knight problem (works for at least 9x9 board)

The problem:

Put n amount of horses on a square chessboard so they control all the spaces.

For example, the least amount of horses that need to be put on an 8x8 board is 12.
You can change the values of knightCount (the number of knights) and boardSize in the header file.
